for a very big form with so many fields and validation use a external lib like formik

Note 2-
useRef hook - ka kaam hota hai React me kisi DOM element ya mutable value ko directly access ya store karna bina re-render trigger kiye.

(The useRef hook in React is a built-in Hook that allows you to persist values between renders of a component without causing a re-render when those values are updated.)

ðŸ”§ useRef in Form: Kaam kya hai?
Agar aap form inputs (like email, password) me useRef use karte ho, to aap:
Directly input ka current value le sakte ho (without using useState)
React ko bar-bar re-render karne ki zarurat nahi hoti
Simple validation ya DOM manipulation ke liye useful hota hai
